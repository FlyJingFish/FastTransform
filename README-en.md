# Brief description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an easy registration code plug-in, which not only adapts to AGP8, but also improves the speed of most registration code plug-ins

## Features

1. This library supports pre-embedded anchor code

2. This library supports post-embedded anchor code

3. This library supports regular expressions and exploration inheritance to find the code to be registered

4. Both methods of embedding anchors can improve the speed compared to AGP8

5. This framework provides several Router on the market The plugin configuration json of the library can be used quickly [located here](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/EasyRegister/tree/master/routerJson)

### Version restrictions

The version supports AGP8.0 and above

1. If the anchor code is embedded in advance, the version requirement is unlimited

2. If the anchor code is embedded in the back, the version requirement is 7.6 and above

3. If you choose to use the reflection method for the anchor code, similar to WMRouter, the version requirement is unlimited

## Usage steps

**Can you give the project a Star before starting? Thank you very much, your support is my only motivation. Stars and Issues are welcome!**

### 1. Introduce plugins, choose one of the following two methods (required)

Depend on plugins in <code>build.gradle</code> in the <strong>project root directory</strong>

- New version

  ```gradle
  
  plugins {
    //Required item ðŸ‘‡ Note that the apply setting must be true
    id "io.github.FlyJingFish.EasyRegister" version "1.0.3" apply true
  }
  ```

- Or old version

  ```gradle
  buildscript {
    dependencies {
      //Required item ðŸ‘‡
      classpath 'io.github.FlyJingFish.EasyRegister:plugin:1.0.3'
    }
  }
  apply plugin: "easy.register"
  ```

### 2. Introduce plugins in app module (required)

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'easy.register'
}

```

### 3. Configure weaving code

Add the following configuration to `gradle.properties` in the root directory of the project. Example.json is placed in the same directory as `gradle.properties`. For detailed instructions, please click here to view it.

```properties
easyRegister.configJson = example.json
```

Other configurations

```properties
//Whether to enable this plugin
easyRegister.enable = true
//Which mode to enable auto only enables optimization in debug mode, debug means that optimization will always be enabled, and release means that optimization is not enabled
easyRegister.mode = auto //auto, debug, release
```

## Use this library as a class library of your own plugin library instead of a plugin

### 1. In your core Android class library Module import plugin

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'easy.register.library'
}

```

Introducing this plugin can embed anchor code into the aar package. Choosing this method means that you want to write your own plugin. The configurations of the first two steps are replaced by your own. You can still import the plugin of the first step into your own plugin library and reuse the logic inside

### 2. Introduce plugins in the class library of your plugin library

```gradle

dependencies {
  implementation 'io.github.FlyJingFish.EasyRegister:plugin:1.0.3'
}
```

### Finally, I recommend some other libraries I wrote

- [AndroidAOP helps Android App transform into an AOP architecture framework. Only one annotation is needed to request permissions, switch threads, prohibit multiple clicks, monitor all click events at once, monitor life cycle, etc.](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/AndroidAOP)

- [OpenImage easily realizes the animated zoom effect of clicking on a small image in the application to view a large image](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/OpenImage)

- [ShapeImageView supports displaying any graphics. It can do anything you can think of](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/ShapeImageView)

- [GraphicsDrawable supports displaying any graphics, but is lighter](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/GraphicsDrawable)

- [ModuleCommunication solves the communication needs between modules and has a more convenient router function](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/ModuleCommunication)

- [FormatTextViewLib supports bold, italic, size, underline, and strikethrough for some texts. The underline supports custom distance, color, and line width; it supports adding network or local images](https://github.com/FlyJingFish/FormatTextViewLib)
